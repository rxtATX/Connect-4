$JQuery with Rachel and Chanita
An in-class assignment. The first attempt we had at working as a team. 
We first established the layout for the grid, but it created issues when it came to selecting elements using jQuery.
Our goal is to get the computer AI to try to win against the player.
Another issue we're going to face is how to get the computer to recognize how close it is to winning and reading any chains of its own tokens.
